FourSquareDemo
==============

An iPad project to retrive and render Four Square points of interest in a collection view.

Demonsrates how to get venues from foursquare API without user authentication. 
Also fetches venue images from the foursquare API. Venue information is also stored locally
to support offline access of information. Currently no images are saved locally but this feature can be added 
later on.

TODO:

1. Application not tested on actual iPad device to see collection view performance.
2. Location currently fixed to helsinki for demo purposes, CLLocationManager can be added later on to get actual location information.
3. Save images to disk so that they are available in offline mode as well.
